We ask you to demonstrate your automation skills by producing a test suite that covers some user workflows. You should also include any tests that would be relevant but are not covered below. However, please focus on the objective of the user story and what it is trying to verify.
Using your preferred test framework, please create a test project using FakeStore API.  We will utilise this API to support a fictitious online store that allows users to: -
 
User Action	Api End Point
Add product to the store	--- POST /products
View the store’s product collection	--- GET / products
View the details of a specific product	--- GET /products/id
Update a product	--- PUT /products/id
Remove a product from the store	--- DELETE /products/id
 
The API details are: -

During the interview, we will review the project to discuss your preferred patterns and the project structure of your tests.  Please send your project before the interview so we have sufficient time to review it.
